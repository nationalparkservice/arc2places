Notes to help me keep clear the various ways in which the state will be mutated.
I've listed the various operations/tasks/tools what have you, and identified the inputs/outputs
for each.

Seed Places:
  describe: Loads translated GIS data into the Places database.
  inputs: GIS dataset, translator, Places url/account*
  output: upload log (table) and modified places database
  notes: This should only be done once, but this is not enforced
         User should first compare GIS data to Place data to avoid duplication.
         Output (upload log) is required for syncing (Get Places Edits and Update Place described below)
         If you plan to use the GIS dataset in the future to update Place, you will need to enable editor tracking now

Edit Places:
  describe: Manual editing via id, or upload via JOSM, or other supported API tools
  inputs: Places url/account
  output: Modified places database

Edit GIS:
  describe: Manual editing via ArcMap or geoprocessing tools
  inputs GIS dataset (writable)
  output: modified GIS dataset
  notes: Editor tracking must be turned on for syncing to work

Get Places Edits:
  describe: Find changes in places within the unit/bbox since last upload, and applies the inverse translation
  inputs: places url/account, translator, date, unit or bounding box
  output: GISP dataset, Modified places database
  notes: The date could be null - get all changesets not loaded with arc2places.
         The date could be max date from the upload log, but this may miss some changes.
         TODO: how am a tracking if a change has been considered and/or dealt with?
         TODO: Figure out the format of the GISP - I Can't capture deletes in a new GIS feature class,
               applying changes to a copy of the GIS feature class is a problem since it has likely changed since the upload.

Reconcile Places Edits:
  describe: Add places edits to GIS and (maybe) reject/correct places edits to match GIS
  inputs: GIS dataset, GISP dataset, places url/account
  output: GIS dataset
  notes: This will be a manual process initially.
         TODO: Need to coordinate with format of GISP
         TODO: manually updating Places will not be necessary if we implement 'authoritive' users/changesets.
         new features in places that are NOT wanted will need to be manually deleted from places
         new features in places that are wanted can be copy/pasted to the GIS dataset
         updates in places that are NOT wanted will need to be manually corrected in places
         updates in places that are wanted will need to be copy/pasted, or posted to the GIS dataset
         deletes in places that are NOT wanted can be restored by bumping the edit data of the feature in GIS
         deletes in places that are wanted can be accepted by deleting the feature in GIS

Update Place:
  describe: Find changes in GIS since last upload, and send them to Places and update the upload log.
  inputs: GIS dataset with editor tracking, Places url/account, translator, upload log (writable)
  output: modified upload log and modified places database


* Places url defaults to: http://10.147.153.193/api/0.6/
* Places account defaults to the current Windows (AD) user.
