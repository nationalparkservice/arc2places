    </a>

    <p><strong>arc2places</strong> is a suite of tools for uploading National Park Service ArcGIS data
      to the <a href="http://insidemaps.nps.gov/places/">NPS Places system</a>.
      It was built to support the <a href="http://insidemaps.nps.gov/places/data-call">centennial data call</a>.
    </p>

    <p>arc2places provides an ArcGIS Toolbox interface for using these tools.
      This document describes how to <a href="#install">install</a> and <a href="#use">use</a> the arc2places
      toolbox.
      Source code and additional information on the arc2places tools can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/nationalparkservice/arc2places">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Installing</h2>
    </a>

    <h3>Install Prerequisites</h3>
    arc2places requires an extension to Python not provided by the standard ArcGIS Python installation.
    This extension handles the authentication with the Places server.  Installation of the extension requires
    a tool that is also not provided by ESRI.  To complicate this further, ESRI puts python in a different
    location on each release, and they also provide multiple versions of python with each release.
    The installaller provided is fairly simple and may not work in all cases.  If you run into trouble,
    please contact us for installation <a href="#support">support</a>.

    <h4>Assumptions</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>You have ArcGIS 10.1sp1 or greater installed on your computer with python installed in the default location.</li>
      <li>You have administrative permissions on your computer (at least write permission to the python folder).</li>
      <li>Windows knows how to open python files (*.py) with the Python interpreter ArcGIS will use (true for standard ArcGIS install).</li>
      <li>You do not have 64bit background geoprocessing enabled.  It can be installed, but if it is enabled, then
      you will need to repeat the prerequisite installation for both the 32bit and 64bit versions of Python.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the arc2places <a href="http://akrgis.nps.gov/apps/arc2places/pre-installer.zip">pre-installer.zip</a>
        (if clicking the link does not download a zip file, then right click on the link and select 'Save link as...').</li>
      <li>Extract/unzip <em>pre-installer.zip</em> to a temporary location that is easily accessible.</li>
      <li>Use windows explorer to browse to the extraction location.</li>
      <li>If you are feeling lucky
        <ul>
          <li>Double click on <strong>install.py</strong> in the extraction location.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise:
        <ol>
          <li>Right click on <strong>install.py</strong> and select <em>Edit with IDLE</em>.</li>
          <li>In the IDLE Editor, select <em>Run -> Run Module</em> from the menu (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>).</li>
          <li>This should open another window that runs the installation program and displays diagnostic output.</li>
          <li>If you see error messages in the IDLE window, contact us for installation <a href="#support">support</a>.
          <li>Close both IDLE windows.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Proceed to instruction for <strong>Install/Update Toolbox</strong>.</li>
      <li>If everything works, you can delete <em>pre-installer.zip</em> and the extraction location.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Install/Update Toolbox</h3>
    The arc2places tool and the translators it uses are still changing quite a bit.  Please make sure you are
    using the most recent version, and check back here for updates before doing a large data upload.

    <ol>
      <li>Download <a href="http://akrgis.nps.gov/apps/arc2places/arc2places.zip">arc2places.zip</a> (updated 2015-10-02).</li>
      <li>Extract/unzip <em>arc2places.zip</em> to a local folder that is accessible to ArcCatalog.</li>
      <li>If you are updating, you should unzip 'on top of' and replace files in the existing
        installation.  You will need to stop and restart ArcCatalog to use the new version.
        Do not try running ArcCatalog with two versions of arc2places installed in two different locations,
        it just gets confused.</li>
      <li>Open ArcCatalog and browse to the extraction location of arc2places.</li>
      <li>Try and expand the arc2places toolbox
      <ul>
        <li>If it opens and you see the contents of the toolbox, installation was probably successful.  (It may still
        fail when executing the tool if you have 64bit background geoprocessing enabled.  See the installation
          prerequisites for more information.)</li>
        <li>If there is a red x on the toolbox icon, or it does not expand, there was a most likely a problem
          installing the prerequisites.  Please try again or contact us for installation <a href="#support">support</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>It is recommended that you turn off background geoprocessing while first using arc2places so that
        you can see any diagnostice warnings or errors.</li>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Using</h2>
    </a>

    <p>The toolbox can be used in ArcCatalog and ArcMap.
      The documentation below is based on ArcCatalog.
      The toolbox has only been tested on ArcGIS 10.3.x
      It should work on ArcGIS 10.1 sp1 or higher.
      It does not yet work with ArcGIS Pro.</p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Before uploading any production data, you are encouraged to test with small datasets.
      Testing should be done with the test version of the Places database.  The tools have a checkbox
      to select publishing to test vs. production.
      View the test version of Places at
      <a href="http://insidemaps.nps.gov/dev/index.html">http://insidemaps.nps.gov/dev/index.html</a>.
      You should verify that sensitive features were not sent, and that the items got the correct tags.
      You can also check the symbology and labels, however features may appear different when rendered in
      Park Tiles.</p>
    <p>During testing you are encouraged to use the tools under 'Features to Places (Step by Step)' toolkit.  If there are
      validation problems, the tools in the 'Useful Tools' toolkit may be useful.  Once you are comfortable with the process,
      and the fitness of your data, you can use 'All in One Tools/Features to Places' to eliminate some of the steps.
    </p>

    <h3>Features to Places</h3>

    <p><em>Send the public features in your ArcGIS dataset to Places.</em></p>
    <p>Translators are provided for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buildings (footprints)</li>
      <li>Points of Interest</li>
      <li>Parking Lots (footprints)</li>
      <li>Trails</li>
      <li>Roads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The translators assume the data is largely compliant with the eGIS data standards,
      however they make a good attempt to support reasonable variants.
      It is possible (and even pretty easy) to modify the translators to support other datasets or non-standard data.</p>
    <p>...</p>



    <h3>Update Places</h3>

    <p><em>Find changes in your ArcGIS features since the upload (or last update) and send them to Places.</em></p>
    <p><strong>This tool is not available yet.</strong></p>



    <h3>Update Features</h3>

    <p><em>Find changes in Places since the last update and integrate them into your ArcGIS features.</em></p>
