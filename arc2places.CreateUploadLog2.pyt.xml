			<resTitle>4b) Create Upload Log From Changeset</resTitle>
		</idCitation>
		<idAbs>Creates a table documenting the upload. The table is built from the Changeset ID created during the upload process (step 3).  The Changeset ID can also be provided by the NPMap team (npmap@nps.gov) after a dataset is uploaded. The upload table is used (and updated) when syncing ArcGIS with Places.&lt;p/&gt;This tool will fail if the Changeset ID does not exist, or is not yet avaialble. This can happen when the changeset has been loaded in the background, and has not finished processing. If you think this is the case, wait a few minutes and try again.</idAbs>
